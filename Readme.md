We will utilize the 'cars_database' as a sample MySQL database. This database encompasses standard business data including customers, products, sales orders, sales order line items, and more. 
The schema of the MySQL sample database comprises the following tables:

## ProductLines: 
stores a list of product line categories.

## Products:     
stores a list of scale model cars.

## Offices:      
stores sales office data.

## Employees:  
stores all employee information as well as the organization structure such as who reports to whom.

## Customers: 
stores customerâ€™s data.

## Orders:     
stores sales orders placed by customers.

## OrderDetails: 
stores sales order line items for each sales order.

## Payments: 
stores payments made by customers based on their accounts.

You can find the code about creating the database and the 8 tables in the [Database and tables](https://github.com/VasilisPappas/SQL.Cars_database/blob/main/Database%20and%20tables) file.
