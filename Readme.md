We'll work with the 'cars_database,' a MySQL sample database containing standard business data like customers, products, sales orders and other relevant information. The schema consists of the following tables:

## ProductLines: 
stores a list of product line categories.

## Products:     
stores a list of scale model cars.

## Offices:      
stores sales office data.

## Employees:  
stores all employee information as well as the organization structure such as who reports to whom.

## Customers: 
stores customerâ€™s data.

## Orders:     
stores sales orders placed by customers.

## OrderDetails: 
stores sales order line items for each sales order.

## Payments: 
stores payments made by customers based on their accounts.

You can find the code for creating the database and the 8 tables in the [Database and tables](https://github.com/VasilisPappas/SQL.Cars_database/blob/main/Database%20and%20tables) file.

* Reference: The specific code was provided by the [MySQL Sample Database](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx).  However, I have made some changes in the order of creating the tables in the [Database and tables](https://github.com/VasilisPappas/SQL.Cars_database/blob/main/Database%20and%20tables) due to constraints related to foreign key references..
